==============

device-floater is a simple gui application that let's you safely float
keyboard and pointer devices managed by X11 (XI2). It provides a subset of the
'xinput float' command.

Multiple floating keyboards, alongside with the master keyboard, can be used
independently by multiple players in games using the stmm-input-gtk-dm library.

To float a device plug it in while the device-floater is in acquiring mode.
To unfloat a device unplug and replug it while it is not in acquiring mode,
it will reappear as a slave device of either the master keyboard or pointer.
When the computer is turned off, the floating devices status is not saved.

The acquiring mode is time limited to prevent you from locking yourself out
of your computer. Type 'device-floater --help' on your terminal for more
information.
