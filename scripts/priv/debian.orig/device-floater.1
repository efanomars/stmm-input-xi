.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Usually all keyboards plugged in a computer are seen as one. By floating them
(see \fBxinput float\fR command) it's possible for an application using the 
libstmm-input-gtk-xi library to see them as separate devices.
This means, for example, that two or more players can play a game in which
each player has it's own keyboard and can use the same keys.

.PP
The \fB--acquire-secs\fR option sets the time allowed to insert the keyboard.
The limit is necessary to prevent users from locking themselves out of their
computer in case the main keyboard is floated accidentally.

.PP
To unfloat a keyboard just plug it out and back in while not in acquire mode.

.PP
\fIWarning\fR: Only works with X11. Under Wayland devices can't be floated.
