#                                 without the ".in" suffix.
#                                 (ex. if value is "control" the file name is "control.in")

#   STMMI_DEBIAN_SRC_TMP_1        The absolute path to a unique temporary file used by this function.
#                                 If empty don't configure file name itself.
#   STMMI_DEBIAN_SRC_TMP_2        The absolute path to a another unique temporary file used by this function.
#   STMMI_PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR      The absolute path to one of the subproject directories
